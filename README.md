# Latent Dirichlet Analysis(LDA): Science and Technology (News and Online Article)	
## Introduction
This repository presents the findings of a comprehensive study on the impact of scientific research breakthroughs and technological developments on various aspects of human life. The study explores the relationships between Artificial Intelligence (AI), 5G integration, STEM education, and creative mobile applications. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) plays a crucial role in uncovering latent themes within the vast dataset, offering essential insights into the undercurrents and motivations behind specific subject matters.

## Motivation
The modern world has witnessed unprecedented progress driven by cutting-edge technologies like AI and the integration of 5G networks. Concurrently, the focus on STEM education has led to the widespread adoption of creative mobile applications, significantly impacting various industries and addressing societal needs. To keep pace with this rapid transformation, tertiary institutions must revamp their curriculums to equip students with essential competencies for sustained success in the ever-changing landscape of human progress.

## Objective
The main objective of this research is to explore explicit connections between AI, Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM), and 5G. We aim to identify latent patterns within the scientific and technological literature through LDA analysis. By uncovering obscured patterns beneath vast corpus systems, LDA provides a methodological approach to comprehending complex data samples beyond human capacity or limitations.

## Dataset and Methodology
The dataset used for this analysis comprises a diverse collection of scientific and technological literature. The LDA analysis used advanced machine learning techniques to discover distinct themes across the corpus. The methodology involved identifying key terms associated with each topic and assessing their probabilities to understand the themes comprehensively. The dataset is from online articles and news. There are 36 text files used. 

## Key Findings
The LDA analysis revealed four main topics:

### Topic 1: Agriculture and Food Security
This topic is centred around agriculture, food, farming, and farmers. The emphasis on food security is evident, with connections to smart technology and space exploration.

### Topic 2: Technology and Electronic Devices
This topic focuses on technology, electronic devices, and innovation. Notably, it references "jaysuman," who played a significant role in developing technological innovations for athletes, including those in the Malaysia Deaf Sports Association (MSDEAF).

### Topic 3: Digital and Renewable Technology
Topic 3 encompasses digital technology, renewable energy, and hydrogen themes. It references "dnb" (Digital Nasional Berhad) and the "ir40" (Fourth Industrial Revolution and digital economy).

### Topic 4: Nanotechnology and Education
Nanotechnology is the central focus of this topic, with connections to education, higher degrees (phd), and graduation. The Malaysian Nanotechnology Industrial Group (MNIG) and discussions on nanotechnology innovation are mentioned.

## Visual Representations
To facilitate comprehension, we have provided scatter plots and tables displaying the probabilities of topic associations for each document, along with term frequencies in the dataset.

## Conclusion
The LDA analysis has highlighted the interconnections between AI, Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and 5G. The study emphasizes the significance of nanotechnology, digital technologies, agriculture and renewable energy advancements. The findings underscore the importance of continuous research and development in these fields to shape the future of global progress.
