Higher Education Ministry allocates RM1.1b for development of public universities in Johor
JOHOR BARU, May 22 — The Higher Education Ministry (KPT) has allocated RM1.1 billion through the 12th Malaysia Plan (RMK12) for 21 development projects involving public universities in Johor.


Johor Menteri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi who paid a courtesy call on KPT Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin today for discussions, said RM612.8 million has been allocated for nine development projects involving polytechnics.

He added that RM96.86 million has also been allocated for seven projects involving Community Colleges in the state.
“The discussion (with the Minister) also touched on several important subjects related to the development of higher education in the state of Johor as well as to look at initiatives to develop human capital,” he said in his Facebook post, today.
Onn Hafiz added that reports from KPT indicated that the marketability of graduates from Johor was at a satisfactory level with 94.1 per cent success.

The Menteri Besar said that the percentage was a positive indicator, but efforts were needed to encourage or attract more youths to pursue their education at a higher level as well as choose technical and vocational skills training (TVET) in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) to cater for the demand of industries and investors.

Therefore, a special working team would be set up between the state government and KPT to outline the working relationship between KPT and the state government to enhance the development of education in the state.

“At the same time, the special team will serve as a bridge to identify and submit a report on the needs of the state in areas of education,” he said. — Bernama
