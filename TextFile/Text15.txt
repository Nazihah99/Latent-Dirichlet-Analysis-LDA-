Drone technology can increase yield in Malaysia’s agricultural sector, says deputy minister
KENINGAU, April 30 — The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Mosti) is striving to develop an ecosystem for the application of drone technology in the field of agriculture to help increase the income of farmers.


Its Deputy Minister, Datuk Arthur Joseph Kurup said the use of drone technology in the agricultural sector can increase yields, reduce dependence on foreign workers and provide job opportunities for farmers, especially in rural areas.

“From studies conducted, the use of drones in the agricultural sector can provide accurate information to farmers in the use of pesticides and fertilisers as well as the health status of crops.
“This allows an increase in crop productivity of around 30 per cent and a reduction in operating costs by 20 per cent and, thus, contribute to an increase in the income of farmers,” he said in a statement today.
He said that science, technology and innovation (STI) had huge potential and could offer the best solution, including in the agriculture and plantation sectors.

The government, through Mosti, is committed to cooperating with various related parties to adapt technology solutions that are effective in ensuring the security of food supply is guaranteed at a reasonable cost. — Bernama
